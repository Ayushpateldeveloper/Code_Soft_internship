          <p>

            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th

            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

        <p>
            Abdul Kalam was the youngest of five siblings and was raised in a devout 
            Muslim family. Despite facing financial challenges, his parents instilled 
            in him strong values of honesty, discipline, and education. His father was
            a boat owner and imam at the local mosque, while his mother was a housewife.
            Kalam had a keen interest in science from a young age. After completing his 
            early education at a local school, he attended the Ramanathapuram Schwartz 
            Matriculation School.His teachers recognized his inquisitive mind and encouraged 
            him to pursue his passion for learning.In 1954, Kalam graduated in Physics from
